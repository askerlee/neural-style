# Laplacian-preserving Neural Style Transfer

An image Laplacian loss is imposed to the original neural style transfer method, so that the produced image better preserves fine details of the original content image.

Check [https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style] for original documentation.

Extra command line argument:
![--content-lapweight 100]
